# Team Matcher
The browser extension is to create skill-even teams from meetup.com event attendees. It can be useful for team sports like soccer, volleyball, etc.

## Compatibility
The extension works in Firefox and Chrome on desktop and in Kiwi Browser on Android (tested in these 3 only). Very few mobile browsers allow users to install extensions.

## How it works
After installing it, the extension adds an extra "Make teams" button to event attendee pages (htt<span></span>ps://w<span></span>ww.meetup.com/&lt;group id>/events/&lt;event id>/attendees/):

The button redirects to www.keamk.com and pop ups the list of attendees from the event. If a person's skill level was evaluated before, the extension will set it to the assigned value. It makes it easier to prepare teams for repeated events with recurring attendees. After assigning skill levels to everyone, you need to click "Generate teams" at the bottom of the www.keamk.com.
